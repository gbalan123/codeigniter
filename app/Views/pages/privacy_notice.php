We will not contact you for marketing purposes by email, phone or text message unless you have given your prior consent (which can be withdrawn on the relevant Medium or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:data.protection@catsstep.education">data.protection@catsstep.education</a>).  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do we protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?</strong></p>

<p>We are committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access, alteration, deletion or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. CSL processes personal information within the European Union although as described above at times a copy may be transferred outside. Information transmitted normally over the Internet can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems as described above. Where we have given (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our Mediums, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.  If you purchase a product or service from one of our licensee organisations (e.g. your school, college or centre) your payment details will not be provided to or held by us, it is collected by the licensee or a third party payment processor specialising in the secure online capture and processing of credit/debit card transactions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do we protect personal information for those aged 16 and under?</strong></p>

<p>We are concerned to protect the privacy of users aged 16 or under. If you are aged 16 or under, your parent/guardian/school's verifiable consent is required at the time of registration, as an integral step to you accessing our Mediums, when your personal information is provided. Your parent/guardian/school will have access to your personal information to review and/or have it deleted, and to prevent further use or online collection of your personal information. We will only retain personal information collected online from any person under 16 years old for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected and will then delete the information to protect against its unauthorised access or use.</p>


<!-- What are ‘cookies’ and how do we use them? -->
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are &lsquo;cookies&rsquo; and how do we use them?</strong></p>

<p>CSL’s Mediums do not use ‘cookies’ except those necessary to enable recording of your preferences (e.g. user’s language so that the correct language will be displayed on the relevant medium) and otherwise as may be needed to enable you to take a preparation course and test. 'Cookies' are small pieces of information sent by an organisation to your computer and stored on your hard drive to allow that website to recognise you when you visit. They collect statistical data about your browsing actions and patterns and do not identify you. You can switch off cookies by setting your browser preferences. Turning cookies off may result in a loss of functionality on our website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What about links to other websites and apps?</strong></p>

<p>Our Mediums may contain links to other mediums of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our sites, you should note that we do not have any control over other websites, apps or other mediums. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this policy. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the mediums in question. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other mediums even if you access them using links from our Mediums. In addition, if you linked to our Mediums from a third party medium, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of that third party and recommend that you check the policy of that third party medium.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How long do we keep your information?</strong></p>

<p>We are required under applicable law to keep your basic personal information (name, address, contact details) for a minimum of six (6) years after which time it will be destroyed. The information we use for marketing purposes will be kept with us until you notify us that you no longer wish to receive this information. We review our retention periods for personal information on a regular basis. We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with us.  </p>
